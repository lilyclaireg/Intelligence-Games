# Intelligence-Games
In Spring 2024, I took Introduction to Programming in Java course (CPSC1060) here at Clemson University. We were assigned a final project that allowed us to creatively create a game! This game is a parallel between the Hunger Games, one of my favorite book series, and the American public education system.
